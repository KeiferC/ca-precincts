# Data Processing 
### County Metadata
Number of precincts and precinct names were retrieved June 2020 from...

### Digitization of Precinct Maps
Raster maps from the county's website were georeferenced in QGIS and then
used to outline precinct boundaries around which census blocks were 
geographically merged. All maps have coordinate reference systems (CRS) 
defined on `EPSG:102003` (USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic) for
georeferencing along the OpenStreetMap (OSM) standard. Additionally, 
the Albers projection is the standard used by the US Census Bureau, 
from which the geographic data comes. The maps are projected in
`EPSG:3310` (NAD83/California Albers) for prioritizing geographic area.

### Data Joining
The block-level and county-level shapefiles were joined to disaggregate county
names to blocks. The script can be found in the Jupyter Notebook `script/join-blocks-counties.ipynb`. The joined shapefile can be found in 
`geodata/census/shp/2010/blocks-counties-joined.zip`.

Shapefile and tabular data joins were done using python. The documented script can be found in the Jupyter Notebook `...`

### GeoData Aggregation
Census-block-level demographics geodata were aggregated into precinct-level election geodata using the python `maup` package. The documented script can be found in the Jupyter Notebook `...`



# Results

- `alameda_blocks.zip`



# Analysis
More detailed analyses can be found in `analyses/`.

> Note: Because of the immigration history and the election requirements of the United States, not all in the Hispanic voting age population (HVAP) nor all in the Asian voting age population (ASIANVAP) are citizens. Consequentially, not all in the HVAP nor in the ASIANVAP are permitted to vote in United States federal elections. Therefore, any ecological regression (ER) or ecological inference (EI) analyses using HVAP or ASIANVAP lack statistical accuracy. It is better to use HCVAP and ASIANCVAP for analysis purposes.



# Naming Reference
